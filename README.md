**Package npANCOVA**

An R Package for Nonparametric Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) Methods

## 📖 **Overview**

Nonparametric methods for analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) are distribution-free and provide a flexible statistical framework for situations where the assumptions of parametric ANCOVA are violated or when the response variable is ordinal. The npANCOVA package implements several well-known nonparametric ANCOVA procedures, including Quade, Puri and Sen, McSweeney and Porter, Burnett and Barr, Hettmansperger and McKean, Shirley, and Puri-Sen-Harwell-Serlin. The dataset of Quade (1967) was used to present the R codes of nonparametric ANCOVA methods.
